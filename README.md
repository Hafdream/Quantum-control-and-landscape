This repository contains code accompanying our paper, [Exploring quantum control landscape and solution space complexity through optimization algorithms and dimensionality reduction](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-95161-0). It provides all scripts and tools needed to reproduce the results and experiments presented.

Some part of this code is forked from https://github.com/93xiaoming/RL_state_preparation
